## _Dotfiles?_

_Dotfiles_ are used to customize your system. The _dotfiles_ name is derived from the (hidden) configuration files in Unix-like systems (that start with a dot).

If you are new into _dotfiles_ management and want to learn more, [Getting started with dotfiles](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789), by Larks Kappert, is a nice starting point.

The excellent [GitHub does dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io/)' site starts explaining why you would want your own _dotfiles_ on GitHub and contains a lot of excellent resources about the topic.

## My _dotfiles_

Not surprisingly, in this repo you can find a bunch of _dotfiles_ containing preferences and settings for my own toolbox (mostly oriented to __web development__ tasks under a __Linux__ machine).

It contains custom settings for, among others:

- Text editors: Atom / Sublime Text 2
- Version control systems: Git / Mercurial
- Linters: JSHint, CoffeeLint
- ...

I recommend to cherry pick the individual files/settings you are interested in and manually add them to your current setup.
