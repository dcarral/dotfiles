## _Dotfiles?_

_Dotfiles_ are used to customize your system. The _dotfiles_ name is derived from the (hidden) configuration files in Unix-like systems (that start with a dot).

If you are new into _dotfiles_ management and want to learn more, [Getting started with dotfiles](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789), by Larks Kappert, is a nice starting point.

## _Dotfiles!_

The excellent [GitHub does dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io/)' site starts explaining why you would want your own _dotfiles_ on GitHub and contains a lot of excellent resources about the topic.

## My _dotfiles_?

Not surprisingly, in this repo you can find the _dotfiles_ containing preferences and settings for my own toolbox (mostly oriented to __web development__ tasks under a __Linux__ machine).

## My _dotfiles_!

Besides my own needs, I keep sharing this repo's URL from time to time, specially to junior and/or new to the Linux world colleagues.

I'd usually recommend to cherry pick the individual files/settings you are interested in and manually apply them.

Note: A custom installation script is coming as soon as I need to restore one of my machines ;)
